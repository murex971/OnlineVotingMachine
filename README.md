# OnlineVotingMachine
A user-friendly webapp to make voting hassle-free and secured using blockchain technology.

#Idea:
The Following features will be included in our Ethereum Blockchain Voting system

1. Votes can be given through any browser supporting Ethereum Client like metamask
2. 2-factor Authentication for identity verification
3. Face-ID verification using preregistered face data
4. Ability change Voters every 6 hours to reduce network workload and prevent misuse by voters. Only the final vote given to any candidate will be counted.
This allows users to not regret voting a particular candidate if a controversy during the election surfaces. This also allows users to fake-vote whenever they feel surrounded or being watched at work/public places. 
5. Live gender-specific Voter-turnout with graphs so that registered online-voters of specific areas/constituency can be notified to vote before the deadline if their turnout is low.
6. Voters will have constituency details stored, to ensure that they only vote for their own constituency and not any other. Hence they can vote from anywhere around the country without having to go there physically.

The Election will have the following 3 major Process:
1. Registration of voters and Candidates
2. Actual Polls
3. Display Election Results 

##Tech Stack:
1. Azure Ethereum POA Consortium
2. Truffle Suite
3. Solidity for smart contracts
4. CosmosDB
